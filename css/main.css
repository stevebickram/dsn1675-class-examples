        /* ^media queries allows us to style sites with large widths that are at max length so objects dont have to be stacked, we must therefore always style sites in their shortest width, and style them according to if the width gets larger and larger. As seen with the above example, the title Media Queries will change as it reaches the 400px (or 25em, which is 400/16) mark, and 700px(45em) mark. As we reach the 400px mark, the font size changes and that change in size becomes inherit to the site, which is why we need to style for short sites, then long sites */
